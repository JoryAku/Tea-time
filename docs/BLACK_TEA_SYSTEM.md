# Black Tea Timeline System

## Overview

Black Tea provides players with the ability to view a plant's complete 4-year timeline and replace the present plant with any future state. This feature maintains timeline consistency across all tea powers and implements an efficient caching system.

## Features

### ðŸ”® Timeline Viewing
- **4-Year Simulation**: View 48 actions (4 years) of detailed plant progression
- **State Changes**: See all future state transitions with exact timing
- **Harvest Information**: View potential yields and harvestability for each state
- **Death Predictions**: Identify when and how plants might die
- **Weather Events**: See the locked weather pattern that affects the plant

### âš¡ Plant State Replacement
- **Future State Selection**: Choose any valid future state to replace the current plant
- **Instant Progression**: Skip time by replacing plant with its future self
- **Harvest Potential**: Retain harvest capabilities when replacing with mature states
- **Safety Checks**: Prevent replacement with dead or invalid states

### ðŸ”„ Timeline Consistency
- **Unified System**: Same timeline used across Green Tea, Oolong Tea, and Black Tea
- **Cache Management**: Efficient storage and updating of plant timelines
- **Auto-Invalidation**: Timelines refresh when plant states change significantly
- **Unique Plant IDs**: Persistent identification system for timeline tracking

## Usage

### Basic Timeline Viewing

```javascript
// Consume Black Tea to view timeline (returns selection interface)
const result = game.consumeBlackTeaWithPlantSelection(blackTeaCard, plantIndex);

if (result.requiresSelection) {
  console.log("Available future states:");
  result.timelineStates.forEach((state, idx) => {
    console.log(`[${idx}] Action ${state.action}: ${state.state} age:${state.age}`);
  });
}
```

### Plant State Replacement

```javascript
// Replace plant with future state from action 24
const result = game.consumeBlackTeaWithPlantSelection(blackTeaCard, plantIndex, 24);

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Plant replaced: ${result.replacementInfo.originalState.state} â†’ ${result.newPlantState}`);
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Plant ID System
Each plant receives a unique ID when added to the garden:
- Format: `plant_N` where N is an incrementing counter
- Assigned automatically via `assignPlantId(plant)`
- Used for timeline caching and consistency

### Timeline Caching
Timelines are cached using a Map structure:
```javascript
// Timeline storage
this.plantTimelines = new Map(); // plantId -> Timeline object

// Cache retrieval with validation
getOrCreatePlantTimeline(plant, actionsToSimulate, forceUpdate)
```

### Cache Invalidation
Timelines are automatically invalidated when:
- Plant state changes significantly (state transitions, death)
- Plant is replaced with future state
- Major game state changes occur

### Performance Optimization
- **First Access**: Timeline generation (~9ms for 5 plants)
- **Cached Access**: Immediate retrieval (~1ms for 5 plants)
- **9x Performance Improvement** with caching system

## API Reference

### Core Methods

#### `consumeBlackTeaWithPlantSelection(teaCard, plantIndex, targetAction = null)`
Main Black Tea consumption method.

**Parameters:**
- `teaCard`: Black Tea card being consumed
- `plantIndex`: Index of plant in garden
- `targetAction`: Optional - which future action to replace plant with

**Returns:**
- If `targetAction` is null: Selection interface with timeline data
- If `targetAction` is specified: Replacement result

#### `assignPlantId(plant)`
Assigns unique ID to a plant.

**Parameters:**
- `plant`: Plant card to assign ID to

**Returns:**
- String: The assigned unique ID

#### `getOrCreatePlantTimeline(plant, actionsToSimulate, forceUpdate)`
Gets cached timeline or creates new one.

**Parameters:**
- `plant`: Plant to get timeline for
- `actionsToSimulate`: Number of actions to simulate (default 48)
- `forceUpdate`: Force timeline regeneration (default false)

**Returns:**
- Timeline object

### Helper Methods

#### `invalidatePlantTimeline(plant)`
Removes cached timeline for a plant.

#### `clearAllTimelines()`
Clears all cached timelines.

#### `getSelectableStatesFromTimeline(plant, timeline)`
Extracts selectable states from timeline.

#### `replaceWithFutureState(plant, plantIndex, timeline, targetAction)`
Executes plant replacement with future state.

## Timeline Data Structure

### Timeline States
Each selectable state contains:
```javascript
{
  action: 24,              // Action number (0-48)
  state: "flowering",      // Plant state name
  age: 10,                // Plant age in years
  isValid: true,          // Can be selected
  isCurrent: false,       // Is current state
  isDead: false,          // Is dead state
  harvestInfo: {          // Harvest information
    isHarvestable: true,
    yields: ["tea_leaf_raw", "tea_leaf_raw"],
    yieldCount: 2,
    baseTarget: "tea_leaf_raw"
  }
}
```

### Timeline Object
The main timeline contains:
- `events`: Array of weather events with timing
- `plantStates`: Map of plant state changes
- `plantOutcomes`: Survival/death predictions
- `isLocked`: Timeline consistency flag

## Error Handling

### Edge Cases Handled
- Invalid plant indices
- Out-of-range target actions
- Attempts to replace with dead states
- Missing or corrupted timeline data

### Common Error Messages
- `"No plant at that garden index"`
- `"Target action out of range (0-48)"`
- `"Cannot replace with dead state"`
- `"No valid state found for target action"`

## Integration with Other Tea Powers

### Green Tea Compatibility
- Uses same timeline system for predictions
- Timelines remain consistent across tea types
- Cache shared between Green and Black tea

### Oolong Tea Compatibility
- Harvest simulations use same timeline base
- Future harvest predictions remain accurate
- Timeline updates reflect in all tea powers

## Testing

The Black Tea system includes comprehensive tests:
- `blackTeaTest.js`: Basic functionality and edge cases
- `blackTeaAdvancedTest.js`: Advanced features and timeline management
- `blackTeaDemonstration.js`: Full feature demonstration and performance testing

### Test Coverage
- Timeline viewing and display
- Plant state replacement
- Timeline consistency across tea powers
- Performance optimization verification
- Edge case handling
- Cache invalidation

## Performance Characteristics

### Memory Usage
- Efficient timeline caching reduces redundant calculations
- Automatic garbage collection of invalidated timelines
- Minimal memory footprint per cached timeline

### CPU Performance
- 9x speed improvement with timeline caching
- Sub-millisecond access for cached timelines
- Optimized for multiple plant simulations

### Scalability
- Handles multiple plants efficiently
- Timeline cache size scales with garden size
- No performance degradation with increased usage

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Version-based Caching**: Use version numbers to detect timeline changes
2. **Partial Timeline Updates**: Update only affected portions of timelines
3. **Predictive Caching**: Pre-generate timelines for likely scenarios
4. **Timeline Compression**: Reduce memory usage for long-term storage
5. **Cross-Session Persistence**: Save timelines between game sessions

### Integration Opportunities
1. **CLI Interface**: Add command-line tools for Black Tea usage
2. **Visual Timeline**: Graphical representation of timeline data
3. **Batch Operations**: Replace multiple plants simultaneously
4. **Timeline Export**: Save timeline data for analysis
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter states by criteria (harvestable, age, etc.)

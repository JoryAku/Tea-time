# Protective Actions Implementation Summary

## Requirements Met ✅

### Action: Water
- ✅ Can be used on Seed, Seedling, Mature, or Flowering/Fruiting stages
- ✅ Protects against the Drought vulnerability for the current turn (2 actions)
- ✅ Applied via new `protect_plant` effect in ActionResolver.js

### Action: Shelter  
- ✅ Can be used on Seedling, Mature, or Flowering/Fruiting stages (NOT Seed)
- ✅ Protects against the Frost vulnerability for the current turn (2 actions)
- ✅ Applied via new `protect_plant` effect in ActionResolver.js

### Gameplay
- ✅ If a weather event matches a plant's vulnerability and the player has not used the protective action that turn, the plant dies
- ✅ If the protective action is taken, the plant continues its lifecycle as normal
- ✅ Protection lasts for 2 actions (current turn)

## Files Modified

1. **engine/ActionResolver.js**: Added `protect_plant` effect handler
2. **data/Cards.json**: Added water/shelter actions to appropriate plant stages
3. **data/Cards.json**: Added drought/frost vulnerabilities to mature, flowering, fruiting stages

## Files Added

1. **test/protectionTest.js**: Comprehensive test suite
2. **demo/protectionDemo.js**: Demonstration of all features

## Key Features

- Water action adds `water` condition which protects against drought
- Shelter action adds `sunlight` condition which protects against frost  
- Protection duration: 2 actions (matches existing weather condition system)
- Stage restrictions enforced through Cards.json action definitions
- Existing vulnerability system leveraged (no changes to core Game.js logic)
- Fully integrated with existing CLI interface

## Testing

All tests pass:
- ✅ Protection works against vulnerabilities
- ✅ Plants die without protection
- ✅ Stage restrictions work correctly
- ✅ Duration system works (2 actions)
- ✅ No regressions in existing functionality
- ✅ CLI integration works properly

## Usage

Players can now select protective actions from the CLI menu:
- `water 0 (garden)` - Protect plant from drought
- `shelter 0 (garden)` - Protect plant from frost

Protection status is shown in the "Current garden conditions" display.

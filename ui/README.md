# UI Folder

This folder is a placeholder for future user interface implementations.

## Potential Future Interfaces:

- **React Web App**: A web-based interface for the tea garden simulation
- **GUI Desktop App**: Using Electron or similar technology
- **Game Engine Integration**: Integration with game engines like Unity or Godot
- **Mobile App**: React Native or native mobile implementations

## Interface Guidelines:

Any future UI implementation should:

1. Use the `TeaTimeEngine` from `../engine/engine.js` as the core game logic
2. Implement the same game loop and action handling as the current CLI
3. Maintain the separation between presentation and game logic
4. Support the full range of game features (planting, weather, seasons, tea processing)

## Current CLI Reference:

See `../cli/cli.js` for reference implementation of how to interact with the engine.

# Tea-time Game Design Summary

## Overview

**Tea-time** is a sophisticated terminal-based garden simulation game where players cultivate tea plants through realistic seasonal cycles, manage complex weather systems, and utilize advanced timeline prediction mechanics. The game combines strategic resource management with deep botanical simulation to create an engaging tea cultivation experience.

## üå± Plant Design System

### Plant Lifecycle Architecture

The game features a comprehensive plant lifecycle system centered around the **Camellia sinensis** (Tea Plant) with six distinct growth states:

#### State Progression
1. **Seed** ‚Üí **Seedling** (1-2 actions)
2. **Seedling** ‚Üí **Mature** (36 actions / ~3 years)
3. **Mature** ‚Üí **Flowering** (4-12 actions)
4. **Flowering** ‚Üí **Fruiting** (3 actions)
5. **Fruiting** ‚Üí **Seed** (3 actions, reproduction cycle)
6. **Dead** ‚Üí **Compost** (3-6 actions, decomposition)

#### State-Based Mechanics
Each plant state has unique characteristics:

- **Needs**: Required resources (water, sunlight) and favorable seasons
- **Vulnerabilities**: Weather events that can cause death (drought, frost, pests, disease)
- **Actions**: Available player interactions (plant, water, shelter, harvest, clone)
- **Transitions**: Automated progression rules with timing ranges

#### Advanced Plant Features
- **Protective Conditions**: Players can apply water/shelter protection lasting 6 actions
- **Active Condition Tracking**: Dynamic countdown of protective effects
- **State Progress Tracking**: Gradual advancement toward next lifecycle stage
- **Unique Plant IDs**: Persistent identification for timeline consistency

### Plant Vulnerability System

Plants face seasonal threats:
- **Drought**: Fatal to seeds, seedlings, mature, flowering, and fruiting states
- **Frost**: Kills seedlings, mature, flowering, and fruiting plants
- **Pests & Disease**: Affects mature, flowering, and fruiting states
- **Rot**: Can destroy harvested tea leaves during processing

## üå¶Ô∏è Weather Design System

### Seasonal Weather Distribution

The weather system operates on realistic seasonal patterns with percentage-based event probabilities:

#### Spring Weather (Growth Season)
- **Rain**: 30% (provides water protection)
- **Sun**: 25% (provides sunlight protection)
- **Cloud**: 10% (neutral conditions)
- **Wind**: 10% (neutral conditions)

#### Summer Weather (Stress Season)
- **Sun**: 25% (beneficial but with heat stress)
- **Rain**: 15% (rare but vital water)
- **Drought**: 15% (major plant threat)
- **Thunderstorm**: 10% (intense water + wind)
- **Clear Night**: 5% (special conditions)

#### Autumn Weather (Transition Season)
- **Wind**: 20% (harvest disruption)
- **Sun**: 20% (final growth opportunity)
- **Rain**: 15% (moderate water supply)
- **Cloud**: 15% (neutral conditions)
- **Frost**: 5% (early killing frost)

#### Winter Weather (Survival Season)
- **Rain**: 30% (with rot risk)
- **Cloud**: 30% (protection from extremes)
- **Sun**: 25% (rare winter warmth)
- **Frost**: 10% (deadly to unprotected plants)
- **Snow**: 5% (extreme conditions)

### Deterministic Weather Generation

The weather system uses advanced seeded random generation:
- **Seeded RNG**: Consistent weather patterns based on game start time
- **Predetermined Forecasts**: 48-action (4-year) weather predictions
- **Seasonal Transitions**: Automatic progression every 3 actions
- **Weight-Based Selection**: Probability-driven event selection

### Weather Condition Effects

Each weather event provides specific conditions:
- **Water**: Protects against drought vulnerability
- **Sunlight**: Protects against frost vulnerability  
- **Heat**: Intensifies summer stress
- **Wind**: Can affect harvesting
- **Rot**: Damages stored ingredients

## ‚è∞ Timeline Design System

### Comprehensive Timeline Architecture

The timeline system represents the game's most sophisticated feature, enabling players to simulate and manipulate plant futures across 4-year periods.

#### Timeline Generation Process

1. **Plant Outcome Determination**: Calculate survival/death predictions
2. **Weather Event Generation**: Create consistent 48-action forecast
3. **Daily Progression Simulation**: Track all state changes and events
4. **Timeline Locking**: Ensure consistency across tea power usage

#### Advanced Timeline Features

**Plant State Tracking**:
- Records every state transition with exact timing
